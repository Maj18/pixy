  summary: 'Unbiased estimation of nucleotide diversity within and between populations'
  description: |
    pixy is a command-line tool for painlessly and correctly estimating 
    average nucleotide diversity within (π) and between (dxy) populations from a VCF. 
    In particular, pixy facilitates the use of VCFs containing invariant (AKA monomorphic) 
    sites, which are essential for the correct computation of π and dxy.
